X-Change Website / Service / Business Description
* A site facilitating the exchange goods and services between users.
    * …roughtly just the additon of an in-site currency to eBay / Amazon.
* People’s good a services are listed in their “closet.”
* Each good or service has an “x-change” value.
* X-Change [XC] is an in-site currency:
    * If a user wants to purchase a service or item, they may pay via any combination of XC’s from their account balance, the EC values of any of their items involved in the trade, or new XC’s purchaced for the scope of the transaction XC’s at the exchange rate of 1 $/XC.
* Multi-party trades will be brokered.
    * Example three party trade:
        * @user_one gets a lighter from @user_three by trading 1 candle + 10 MC to @user_two who trades 1 knife + 5 MC to @user_three:
            * 1 candle + 10 MC from @user_one to @user_two
            * 1 knife + 5 MC from @user_two to @user_three
            * 1 lighter from @user_three to @user_one
* The system will search for and suggest possible multi-party trades to said trade participating users.
* Users may view each other’s closets.
* Users may search for items and users by keyword:
    * Keywords match item tags.  Items get tagged with keywords. (# symbol)
    * Keywords match user names. (@ symbol)
* Users may search for items based on XC value range.
* Item shipping must be handled by each individual users.
* Users will be rated by their customers.
* [Important] Over time each user’s account may build up a balance of XC’s.  Their only option to use these will be for them to purchase other user’s goods and services.

This final point, that over time each user’s account may build up a balance of XC’s and that their only option to use them will be to purchase other user’s goods and services is the business value of this site’s whole idea, to capture users, along with their transactions.  It is likely that users will desire to spend whatever XC balance their account accumulates.

What unique value will this site offer to its users?  What motivation will they have for choosing it?  Users will be attracted to X-Change because it:
* Enables them to trade they currently possess for items they desire.
* It suggests and brokers multi-party transactions.
